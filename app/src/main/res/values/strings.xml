    <string name="style1_news">A set of blunt bangs works great with oval face shapes (particularly if you have a larger forehead). Customize their thickness to suit your individual texture, but make sure the length sits at or just below your eyebrows for the most flattering effect.
The full fringe wasn’t a thing until the 1920s, when it was memorably donned by Louise Brooks in the 1929 film Pandora’s Box. Then there was 1950s pin up girl Bettie Page’s fringe which, along with her jet black hair and blue eyes, was her trademark look. And who can forget Elizabeth Taylor’s iconic blunt bags in the film Cleopatra, which catapulted fringes to the forefront and was requested by every hairdresser in the 1960s?
In the 1980s and early 90s, the fashion set opted for a more natural feel and fringes were often curled and wispy.

A poorly-executed layered haircut can cause lots of annoying issues. It can make your hair look frizzy with many flyaways, make you look unintentionally older, and draw attention to perceived facial flaws.
